<h3>Review: Final Team Project Introduction</h3>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final project will assess the application of data mining methods and programming techniques introduced in this course. You will be assigned to a group by your instructor. You and your teammate(s) will work closely to find a dataset, clean and pre-process it, and perform a data mining project (Classification project is preferred!) on the data using&nbsp;<em>either</em>&nbsp;R or Python. It is&nbsp;<em>strongly&nbsp;</em>recommended that you and your team use and practice&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://ole.sandiego.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-3087270-dt-content-rid-31241797_1/xid-31241797_1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://ole.sandiego.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_111316_1&amp;content_id=_3087172_1&amp;mode=reset#contextMenu" id="cmlink_81e6b69ce6c14c9d8cc8f83a01443b3c" title="Click for more options"><img alt="Click for more options" src="https://learn.content.blackboardcdn.com/3900.69.0-rel.35+f94c281/images/ci/icons/cmlink_generic.gif" /></a>&nbsp;as a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration during this project. It is also necessary to create and add a&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://ole.sandiego.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-3087270-dt-content-rid-33906000_1/xid-33906000_1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">README</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://ole.sandiego.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_111316_1&amp;content_id=_3087172_1&amp;mode=reset#contextMenu" id="cmlink_ed386112f2c94b33970836caab77563f" title="Click for more options"><img alt="Click for more options" src="https://learn.content.blackboardcdn.com/3900.69.0-rel.35+f94c281/images/ci/icons/cmlink_generic.gif" /></a>&nbsp;file to your GitHub repository. In addition, always keep in mind that in data mining and data science projects, there is no free lunch (&ldquo;<em>there is no &ldquo;super algorithm(s)&rdquo; and &ldquo;techniques&rdquo; that will work perfectly for all data sets</em>&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Module 2 (by the end of Week 2): The course instructor will group students into teams of two to three members. Blackboard, USD Email, or Slack can be used to find prospective team members.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Module 4 (by the end of Week 4): Each team should select and introduce a dataset and the programming language of their choice. The team representative will need to submit the &quot;Team Project Status Update Form.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Module 7 (by the end of Week 7): Each team should submit deliverables for the course project in the final week:
	<ul>
		<li>One PDF document containing a final report explanation for analyses, interpretations (6-10 pages), and code (Appendix).</li>
		<li>One video recording of the project presentation by all team members. PowerPoint slides are optional.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>It is critical to note that&nbsp;no extensions&nbsp;will be given for any of the final projects due dates for any reason, and final projects submitted after the final due date will not be graded.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Project Datasets:</strong></p>

<p>You will be responsible for finding a dataset for this data mining project. Several free data resources&rsquo; links are provided within the&nbsp;<a href="https://usd-msads.github.io/resources/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Resources</a>&nbsp;page on the MS-ADS GitHub website.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Divide the work equally between the team members for the following steps, and everyone needs to code. You are expected to write high-quality, efficient, and readable code. This project requires that you and your team conduct a 10-15 minute presentation in the last week of the class and submit a final report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Data Mining Process, your presentation, and report should contain the following steps (Note: Deployment is not required in this course):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your presentation and report should also include:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>
	<ol>
		<li>Your task/problem/question, background, and motivation for this data mining project. Clearly state the problem that you have selected to investigate in this data mining project.</li>
		<li>An overview of what your project involves, including a high-level plan for the methods that have been applied in this technical project.</li>
		<li>A description of the source and the raw dataset that you perform your data mining skills.</li>
		<li>All the data mining steps should be explained, such as data preparation and data cleaning steps: what steps do you take to get it into a format amenable to analysis? Are there missing variables or outliers? What methods do you perform for EDA and what are your findings?&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Preliminary and interesting results for your main data mining task.</li>
		<li>Discussion and conclusions (what actions should be taken?), including possible extensions/next steps (that are beyond the scope of the course but that would be cool/practical to do).</li>
		<li>References and Appendices. Provide the process and code that you have performed with detailed results in Appendix. Give an appendix that contains code and information that would allow another data science student to repeat your analyses.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Project Deliverables and Submission Format:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Implement the project in&nbsp;<em>either&nbsp;</em>Python or R language. Use Jupyter notebook/Google Colab for Python or R Markdown for R language. Within the Python notebook or R code, import all packages used for the project in the first cell, use code cells for code and comments and use markdown cells for headings and descriptions. Generate a&nbsp;<strong>PDF</strong>&nbsp;document for submission with&nbsp;<em>code</em>, comments, and results within the notebook. Attach this document as an&nbsp;<em>Appendix&nbsp;</em>to your final report.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Write and submit your final project report using any word processing software in APA 7 style -&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://ole.sandiego.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-3087270-dt-content-rid-28899580_1/xid-28899580_1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sample Professional Paper</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://ole.sandiego.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_111316_1&amp;content_id=_3087172_1&amp;mode=reset#contextMenu" id="cmlink_87ea9daff3db4a62b065083f80eb821c" title="Click for more options"><img alt="Click for more options" src="https://learn.content.blackboardcdn.com/3900.69.0-rel.35+f94c281/images/ci/icons/cmlink_generic.gif" /></a>&nbsp;. The final report (without Appendices), including text and selected tables/graphs,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>should be 6-10 pages.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Prepare a recorded video presentation of your project (slides are optional, but recommended) using a screencasting tool, such as Screencast-O-Matic or Zoom to record your screen and provide a voice narration.
